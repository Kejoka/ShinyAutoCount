# ShinyAutoCount - Auto-Counter for Shiny Hunting

## Functionality
This is an application that lets the user select an area on their screen that should be scanned for a word of their choice. 
If said word is found, a value in a new or existing .txt File will be incremented

## Usage
1. Choose the word you want to look for 
    -> Exmaple: "Newmoon" if you're soft-resetting Darkrai
2. Choose the area that your chosen word should be looked for in
    -> SAC provides a live preview image of your selected area. Make sure the area is large enough since the text-recognition can be faulty if used on small images
3. Insert the path to your existing .txt File or Browse for it on your computer
4. Start the Counter
